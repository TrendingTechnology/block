The domains in this list are wildcards and can be used in various blockers but not by all, for example, [AdAway](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.adaway/) or the [hosts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)) file itself doesn't offer this possibility.

I use this collection when I generate the `blacklist.txt` file, usually used in [dnscrypt-proxy](https://github.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-proxy).

For this reason the entries in `domains-blacklist-local-additions.txt` file could result optimized on the  based on the `example-blacklist.txt` file
